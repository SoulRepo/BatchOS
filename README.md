# BatchOS
A cool game using Command Prompt.

Created by Souliousery.
# What is it?
BatchOS is as the description says. Totally nothing else. Don't doubt the developer.

Currently in development, here's some code for bad mods that can't be my normal game.

It is similar to one of those "Choose your own adventure" books.
# How to use?
Currently, BatchOS is ready for Windows systems.
